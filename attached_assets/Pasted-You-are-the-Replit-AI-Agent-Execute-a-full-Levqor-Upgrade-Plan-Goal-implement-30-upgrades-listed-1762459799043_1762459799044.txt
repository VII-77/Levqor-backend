3. Replace JSONL storage with PostgreSQL (Supabase or Neon free tier).
4. Implement authentication (Clerk, Auth0, or Supabase Auth).
5. Build visual workflow builder UI (React drag-drop for tasks).
6. Create predefined automation templates library.
7. Add team/multi-user system (roles, orgs).
8. Launch marketing/docs site (Docusaurus or Notion-sync).
9. Expand SEO & analytics tracking (Plausible or GA4 events).
10. Add backlinks & blog content seed for visibility.
11. Integrate uptime & latency dashboard (API endpoint + chart).
12. Implement free-trial to paid conversion flow (email nudges).
13. Enable Stripe invoice branding & tax/VAT support.
14. Add billing analytics via ChartMogul or ProfitWell API.
15. Embed customer chat/support widget (Crisp or Intercom).
16. Enable structured logging + backup rotation.
17. Add GDPR cookie consent banner & privacy control.
18. Set automated onboarding emails (welcome/setup/tips).
19. Deploy system status dashboard (uptime, version, metrics).
20. Publish API docs portal (Swagger UI or Postman collection).
21. Implement affiliate/referral tracking system.
22. Improve UI/UX polish (animations, trust badges, testimonials).
23. Add landing videos & optimized conversion copy.
24. Track churn, MRR, and usage analytics (internal dashboard).
25. Add feedback form integrated with Notion database.
26. Harden security (rate limiting, JWT sessions, HTTPS enforcement).
27. Create daily snapshot backup & restore utility.
28. Add multi-region fallback instance (Railway + Vercel mirror).
29. Integrate performance test suite (k6 or locust).
30. Embed AI setup assistant (in-app guide powered by GPT API).

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
Phase 1: Stability → tasks 1–3  
Phase 2: Access & Scalability → tasks 4–7  
Phase 3: Visibility & SEO → tasks 8–11  
Phase 4: Revenue Optimization → tasks 12–14  
Phase 5: Support & Compliance → tasks 15–18  
Phase 6: Reporting & Docs → tasks 19–21  
Phase 7: Experience & Retention → tasks 22–25  
Phase 8: Security & Redundancy → tasks 26–29  
Phase 9: Intelligence → task 30

RULES
- Maintain rollback checkpoints before each phase.
- Update docs/UPGRADE_TRACKER.md with each completed step.
- Never overwrite core billing, AI agent, or scheduler scripts without backup.
- Verify endpoints after every modification:
  /ready, /status, /billing/health, /ops/selftest.
- Print only summary: phase, step, success/fail, next step.

FINAL OUTPUT
When all steps complete:
- Print summary table of 30 tasks (status, duration).
- Generate docs/LEVQOR_UPGRADE_REPORT.md detailing new capabilities, costs, and verification results.

SAFETY
- Use local simulation for DB or external APIs if credentials missing.
- If deployment blocked by port limits, queue deployment commands.
- Abort if ledger drift ≠ $0.00 or webhook errors >0.
